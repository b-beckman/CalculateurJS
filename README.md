# Average Calculator CFC

* First usage of JS HTML/CSS and the local storage.

## Goals: 
* Copy a FIGMA created beforehand in HTML/CSS in the most precise way.    
* Create an algorithm in JavaScript that stores, calculates and displays my average marks reactively.  
* Save my marks in the local storage.
